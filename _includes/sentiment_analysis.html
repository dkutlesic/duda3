          ABSA showed that Aroma and Taste are key when people write a review. These aspects 
          influence the reviews overall. Now we want to go deeper to find out which <u><i>aspect
           characteristics</i></u> map into a high rating. We cannot conduct this analysis globally
            since different beers may have different traits. For example, we expect one to
             mention citrus notes for a Grape beer and not for an IPA, which is characterized 
             as bitter. Thatâ€™s why we conduct our analysis for beer styles individually,
              but only on those with at least 40k reviews, so that we have enough data points
               to declare the results valid. There are 15 such beer styles in the dataset.

          To answer our question, we start by investigating which style-specific 
          keywords extracted from review text correlate with a high rating. 
          We call these <u><i>overall keywords</i></u>. For each style, we take the top 100 most 
          frequent words in all reviews of that style from which stopwords are excluded. 
          Now, similarly to ABSA, we construct binary indicators for each keyword, denoting 
          its presence in each style-specific review. To see how each keyword influences 
          the grades, we conduct <u><i>linear regression</i></u> with Rating (an aggregate of 
          numerical aspect grades) as the target and indicators as covariates. Finally,
           we obtain <u><i>overall keywords</i></u> as those whose coefficients we are certain in 
           (p-value &lt; 0.05) and for which the change in Rating is greater than 0.1 
           when having (or not) it in the formula.
