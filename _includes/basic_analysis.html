          To answer our first question regarding the beer aspects most important to consumers,
           we conduct <i><u>aspect-based sentiment analysis</i></u> or <i><u>ABSA</i></u>. We do this by conducting 
           an <i><u>observational study</i></u> between "absolute winner" and "absolute loser" beers, 
           which we'll explain in a bit. Before that, we have to introduce a preprocessing step. <br>
          Considering that numerical ratings don't convey proper information about users' attitude
          towards a beer, we give our BEERT model the context (one of the four beer aspects) and it 
          provides us with positive/neutral/negative <i><u>sentiment score</i></u> for each aspect from the textual 
          review. The scores are in the [0,1] interval and sum up to 1. Since we want to determine if a 
          certain aspect of sentiment exists, we convert each sentiment score to <i><u>indicators</i></u> by setting 
          up a threshold and comparing them to it. What's more, as we look for aspects with a strong sentiment, 
          our goal is to have only one of the three aspect-specific indicators present (which means that this 
          sentiment is dominant) or to have them all being zero (we are not certain that the sentiment is
          polar enough). This is achieved by a threshold of 0.5 (restricting the other two scores to be at 
          most 0.5), but to be very confident in our results, we set up a threshold of 0.9.

          Our observational study compares two groups of beers: 
          <u><i>absolute winner</i></u>, with all numerical aspect ratings greater 
            than an <u><i>absolute loser</i></u> beer. We want to investigate how does each aspect sentiment derived
             from text influence the overall rating. Therefore, we randomly match pairs of better and worse beers, 
             but we have to be careful in this process and try to eliminate as many confounders as possible that might 
             endanger our analysis. Matched beer reviews:

             <li class="lead">are written by the <u><i>same user</i></u></li>
             <li class="lead"> are related to beers with the same <u><i>style</i></u> and <u><i>alcohol by volume (ABV)</i></u> <br></i></u></li>
             <li class="lead"><u><i>do not differ largely in size</i></u>, due to the BEERT inferring higher sentiment scores for longer reviews <br></li>
             <li class="lead">are given in the <u><i>same season</i></u>, to cancel out any possible underlying seasonal effects <br> <br></li>  
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="text-justify lead">
          After getting a p-value = 1.79e-05 (which is less than the ordinary 0.01), we can conclude that the difference in
          the mean values is significant, therefore these two distributions most likely come from two different
          distributions - where the mean for females is a bit lower than the one for males.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify lead">
          This could lead us to the conclusion that older female politicians talk less about climate change than their
          male colleagues.
          However, taking the first plot into the account, we can observe a much bigger number of older male politicians
          than females - making the older female politicians, to some extent, underrepresented.
