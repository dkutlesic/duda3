          So, we can see that number of quotes with respect to age parameter follows a Gaussian-like distribution, with
          small
          anomalies. <br>
          Now, let's see if the age structure changes when we add the aforementioned gender dimensionality.

          The visual representation of the age analysis with added gender dimensionality for climate change quotes
          (i.e. the second plot), as
          well as the <em>mean</em> values, are similar - we could ask ourselves if these
          two distributions are coming from the same underlying distribution. Since the std values are similar, we can
          apply the ttest.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify lead">
          After getting a p-value = 1.79e-05 (which is less than the ordinary 0.01), we can conclude that the difference in
          the mean values is significant, therefore these two distributions most likely come from two different
          distributions - where the mean for females is a bit lower than the one for males.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify lead">
          This could lead us to the conclusion that older female politicians talk less about climate change than their
          male colleagues.
          However, taking the first plot into the account, we can observe a much bigger number of older male politicians
          than females - making the older female politicians, to some extent, underrepresented.
